[**TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)**](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) allows us to deploy light-weight state-of-the-art (SoTA) machine learning models to mobile and embedded devices. It reduces the memory footprints of the heavier deep learning models and thereby enhances the latency in producing predictions. This makes TensorFlow Lite a very ideal candidate for mobile and embedded-based machine learning applications which tend to operate in resource-constrained environments.

There were a number of interesting announcements made on TensorFlow Lite during [TensorFlow Dev Summit 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzuJw20FG82Lgm2SZjTdIXU). In this session, **Khanh LeViet** will take us through “**What's new in TensorFlow Lite from DevSummit 2020**”. Towards the end of the session, there will be a mini QA round so that you can bring your TFLite questions to Khanh.

Khanh is a Developer Advocate at Google on the TensorFlow Lite team. You can know more about Khanh from [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lvgk/).

### Session abstract and prerequisites

TensorFlow Lite is the official framework for running TensorFlow model inference on edge devices such as smartphones. Edge devices have become more powerful each year, and they enable an increasing number of on-device machine learning use cases. In this session, we will explore how TensorFlow Lite is pushing the limits of on-device machine learning by enabling SoTA models and faster runtime. We will also see how mobile developers without ML expertise can get leverage TensorFlow Lite through a Model Maker, a tool to create SoTA ML models with transfer learning.
