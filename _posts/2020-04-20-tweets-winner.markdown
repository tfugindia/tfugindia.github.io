Keeping up with the spirit of increasing productivity in these trying times TFUG Kolkata had organized [TweetsOnTF](/tweets-on-tf) a fun twitter contest from 27th March onwards.

Holding to the timeline of the contest TweetsOnTF we ended the contest on April 17th, 2020. A total of 30 entries had come in by then. We divided the entries amongst ourselves a devised a two-stage plan to rank them. Six of us distributed all **30 tweets** amongst ourselves in the following way:
- We split ourselves into two teams of three.
- Each team ranked 15 participants in the first round.
- The entries were then swapped between the teams in the second round.
- This ensured fair judgment and removal of any bias.
- The consolidated scores were then compared and ranked.

#### Judging Criteria:
As mentioned in the previous post  announcing the contest, the criteria for judging the tweets were based on the following:
- Effective communication of ideas.
- Conformation to the rules of the contest.
- The relevance of the topic chosen to the community.
- **No room for plagiarism**.

Some participants failed to meet these criteria and were sadly eliminated from the contest. While the purpose of the contest was to promote learning and sharing knowledge it was also meant for open sharing of ideas. We heartily thank each and every member who took part in this contest and encourage them to not pause this streak of knowledge-sharing and community building.
