We are all collectively going through a tough time and its difficult to stay calm and focused. As community organizers, we feel an obligation here to figure out ways to help people fight through it. Being a technical community primarily what we all could think of was “*distraction through education*”.

In this post, we are going to share what we have learned so far from our ongoing experience of hosting online sessions/events. We hope it would help other community organizers (preferably in tech) in figuring out how they could facilitate better online sessions/events in general.

### Sessions are not ***Events***

TensorFlow User Group is a team of folks who have experience in organizing events in the past and the majority of the team members have held community leadership positions. This allowed us to culminate all our learnings together and think out regarding planning our activities online.

What we have seen in our experiences is people tend to generalize events to be just sessions while *we feel* that events are not just restricted to sessions. For example, currently, we recently wrapped up a fun contest called **[<span class="underline">TweetsOnTF</span>](https://tfugkol.github.io/tweets-on-tf/)** and it’s safe enough to term it as an (online) event. So, our take here is don’t just restrict your online events to sessions, expand them to Hackathons, Challenges (here’s a [<span class="underline">good example</span>](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/tfugmumbai/events/269586837/)), QnA, etc.

### Use Meetup (if possible)

We understand that not all the communities have access to a [<span class="underline">valid Meetup subscription</span>](http://meetup.com) but in case if a community organizer has access to a valid Meetup subscription, we think it should be utilized to its fullest extent. Here are some of our findings -

Meetup now supports hosting online events making it even easier to organize them. Here’s an example -

It allows us to put any URL respective to the event which, in turn, makes it easier for the attendees to navigate through the information. Many of the Meetup members might not check the event announcement posts on Social Media. So, in that case, also, Meetup makes it quite easy for them to get notified about the event since Meetup sends out notifications via email when a new event is announced.

Additionally, Meetup allows an organizer to send emails to the Meetup mailing list. So, after announcing the event, *we found it to be a good practice to send email notifications on a regular interval to our Meetup mailing list*. This helps to spread the word in a more formal and structured manner to the community.

### Be a responsible event organizer

This is particularly applicable to ***online sessions***. It does not appear to be a good practice if a speaker just appears, takes the session, and just go away. This is exactly where we as organizers can do our bit. Here are three things that we follow -

- Introduce the speakers.
- Help them with moderation/facilitation during the session/QnA so that the speakers can solely focus their sessions.
- End the session with a thank-you note for the speakers.
- Sync up with the speaker and try to make his slides/resources available to the audience if possible.

### Design matters

Designing plays a very important role while promoting an event. It’s the poster that catches the eye of anyone who is following our social media handle. We at TFUG Kolkata believe in keeping our designs, poster simple, and clean. Every poster should have a proper logo of the community, the event name, date, and time of the event and information about the speaker (name, designation, and picture). If there’s any additional information needed to be plugged in we think it’s better to break it down to two or more posters.

**For example**: In our twitter event TweetsOnTF Contest we have split it into two posters one for the timeline of the event so that viewers can solely focus on the deadlines we are trying to hit and another containing the event rules.

### Some PR hacks

The ongoing crisis makes it really challenging to effectively promote the events. We empathize that due to this crisis, people might not keep up-to-date with what is happening around when it’s mostly filled with the news of deaths, disease spread, and so on.

This is why after announcing an event/session, we try to get our community members excited with the kind of content that would be catered to them via that event/session. This also helps us in getting to know about our community members better via meaningful conversations and instilling a sense of “*we are in it together*”. We have a [<span class="underline">public Telegram group</span>](http://t.me/TFUGKol) that is open to everyone and we interact with the community members through the group.

We also take advantage of ***scheduled posts*** wherever possible. Currently, TensorFlow User Group Kolkata exists on the following platforms:

- [<span class="underline">Twitter</span>](https://twitter.com/TFUGKol)
- [<span class="underline">Meetup</span>](https://www.meetup.com/TFUG-Kol)
- [<span class="underline">Facebook</span>](http://facebook.com/TFUGKol/)
- [<span class="underline">LinkedIn</span>](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tfug-kol/)

Among the above-mentioned platforms apart from LinkedIn and Meetup, all of them support *direct scheduled posts*. So utilizing that, we schedule regular posts to make it easier for the followers to catch up with the announced session/event.

On D-Day (most helpful when it is a session), we generally publish two scheduled posts - ***30 minutes before*** and ***5 minutes before***. In the case of our twitter event [**<span class="underline">TweetsOnTF</span>**](https://tfugkol.github.io/tweets-on-tf/) we made sure that we informed everyone before closing the entries. We additionally tried replying to most of the participants to instill a sense of belonging to the community.

### PR Suggestions for Future

We have thought of how to grow the community in every sense of the word and come with certain pointers that we may be implementing in the future.

The sessions are certainly great as standalone videos on specific topics. To inspire open sharing of knowledge we may keep on posting our sessions along with other relevant resources from around the web. For e.g we have a session on TFLite, what we could do is create a public **YouTube playlist** of some other resources on the topic (from *any viable creator*) and then share it as TFLite Playlist

What this does is specifically bring in people who are **searching for those specific topics.** We believe this might be a way we can attract fresh and interested people in our community.

### Know Your Audience

In online events the biggest challenge is you don’t get to see your audience. Thus, the reactions and feedback solely come from the interaction we have in the live chat or in the surveys. Hence, it becomes extremely important to get more and more people to live when your session is on. The likes on social media posts or views on those posts give a very rough count of the number of attendees. Having an RSVP in the initial stages of the promotion will help the PR Team to know how far the event is reaching, the regions/areas/college, etc. This will help the Team to know areas where they need to extend their reach. So, a forever open **RSVP** via *Google Forms* will be helpful in this regard.

### The medium of the session/event

Where do we conduct a session/event? What is the best one out there? Rather than answering what is the best out there, we will share what has worked for us so far.

We use a combination of YouTube Live and [<span class="underline">Stream Yard</span>](https://streamyard.com/) when it is a one-time speaking engagement. YouTube makes it quite seamless to run live sessions and it provides sufficient controls to better facilitate them.

With [<span class="underline">Stream Yard</span>](https://streamyard.com/), we aim to make the sessions more engaging by displaying any necessary links the speaker is sharing, and quick announcements to be made during the session, and so on. Stream Yard also makes it very easy to communicate with the speaker(s) during the live session(s) by offering features like *Private Chat Window*.

For the other event that we are running (**TweetsOnTF**), we are using Twitter. For running Hackathons, it’s better to create a static website and put all the important pieces of information together in it. [<span class="underline">Google Sites</span>](https://sites.google.com/) or [<span class="underline">Fastpages</span>](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) by [<span class="underline">fastai</span>](https://www.fast.ai/) can make the process really easier.

### Facilitate - ‘Read More’

Attendees of online events or sessions might not always be at the present. YouTube videos have a way of collecting views after the video is published. Circulating 'Read more' content, inclusive of but not limited to slides, Blog posts, videos, white papers, jamboards or notebooks etc. enables the attendees to get more equipped in case they drop off in the middle due to a patchy connection or join after the session is over. This not only ensures that the learning curve remains smooth but we also leave a wonderful collection of knowledge in the wake of the events.

### Post Scriptum

All of these points are in no way directions or commandments issued. In our course of hosting online events and witnessing communities coming together and organizing the same, we have learned a great many things, and these are some of our takeaways. We hope that these come in handy for other communities and chapters and help them grow and stay productive in these trying times. After all, that is the essence of a community.
